                <h3>WIM | WHAT IS MY MAJOR?</h3>
                <p>WIM? stands for “What Is My Major?” is a website which is mainly suitable for Students who are going
                    to graduate from high school or who are looking for a major, particularly students who struggle to
                    choose a major or are hesitant about the major that they are going to choose. Moreover, our website
                    will assist students in their college decision to find their preferred/suitable major by assigning
                    majors based on the responses to our queries.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>WIM for WHO?</h3>
                <p>WIM is for EVERYONE! Are you looking for major? Are you stuck in deciding your education path? WIM is
                    for you. As mentioned above, WIM can help you make decision on pursuing your education in the
                    university. WIM website will principally use the AUPP majors in order to reduce the scope of
                    designing the
                    algorithm
                    that can recommend all majors in Cambodia instead we limit it to the majors available at AUPP
                    including
                    Business Administration, Global Affairs, Information Technology Management and Computer Science,
                    Information and Communication Technology, Law and lastly Tourism and Hospitality Management and
                    in a way to promote AUPP as well. Students will go through several questions and choose answers
                    based on what and how they are interested.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Why WIM?</h3>
                <p>WIM will help to determine and recommend an appropriate major. As a result, students will be given
                    the
                    most appropriate major to help them decide whether or not to pursue it. However, for those students
                    who
                    decided their major already but insufficiently, the website will also fulfill their missing space to
                    finalize their appropriate major. Following this, there will be criteria answers that
                    convert the students' responses and output their suitable major for them at the end of the query.
                    Therefore, we will recommend AUPP majors at the end of their quiz, along with a description of the
                    major, course information, and other relevant information.

                <h3>Who behind WIM?</h3>
                <div id="profile">
                    <p> WIM website is creditably contributed by Chap Chanmanith and Yeang Lyhour who established this
                        website by
                        developed this website from scratch. Additionally, the website is originally designed by our own
                        concept and mixed enterprise after a several discussions of established this idea. After the
                        completion of this project, we are hoping to continue maintain this website and publish it for
                        the public uses especially Cambodian's students (which will hopefully available in Khmer
                        Language). We are hoping that this website would be a small factor in the decision of pursuing
                        Bachelor Degree education for all high school students.
